      <description>I am a happy owner of Inetl NUC computer. Recently I installed Fedora on it (right after I tested it as a VM). It was minimal installation. After I had logged in, I noticed that wireless network interface was unavailable. Quite wierd, taking into account that it worked fine during the installation process.
I looked around, device was connected:
# lspci ... 3a:00.0 Network controller: Intel Corporation Wireless 8265 / 8275 (rev 78) .</description>

      <description>Let me start with saying that I have been an ubuntu guy. Back in 2008 I met ubuntu first time, since than I have used different linux operating systems. In 2014 I switched to deb-based distros on my desktop. For some reason every time I tried redhat-like OS, the venture failed. Every time some crap happened. In addition, I donâ€™t really like neither the current fedora artwork nor its fonts.</description>
